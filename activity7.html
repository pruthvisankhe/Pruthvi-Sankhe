            Hi, my name is 
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #d00000;">Pruthvi Sankhe</span>, 
            and I am a passionate learner dedicated to expanding my knowledge in various fields. 
            I am a dedicated <strong>student</strong> with a passion for learning and a drive to explore new ideas. 
            As I navigate my academic journey, I am always eager to expand my knowledge and skills, 
            both inside and outside the classroom. I am committed to pushing myself to achieve academic 
            excellence while balancing my personal growth and development. Every challenge I face is an 
            opportunity to learn, and I approach each one with an open mind and determination.
        </p>

            In my studies, I focus on <strong>computer science</strong>. 
            My passion lies in <strong>cybersecurity</strong>, especially in developing strategies 
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">to protect data and systems from cyber threats and 
            ensuring privacy in the digital world</span>. I strive to deepen my understanding through research, 
            projects, and collaboration with my peers. I enjoy engaging in discussions and working on projects that 
            challenge my perspectives and allow me to think critically.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Beyond academics, I’ve participated in a 
            <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">strong internship</span> 
            where I gained hands-on experience and applied my classroom knowledge to real-world challenges. 
            These activities help me develop <span style="font-weight: bold;">leadership</span>, 
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">teamwork</span>, and <span style="font-weight: bold;">time management skills</span>. 
            I believe in the importance of balancing work and life, and I am always seeking new ways to grow both 
            personally and professionally. My ultimate goal is to make a positive impact in my community and contribute 
            meaningfully to the field I’m passionate about.
