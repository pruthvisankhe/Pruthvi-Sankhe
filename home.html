            Hi, my name is <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #d00000;">Pruthvi Sankhe</span>, 
            and I am a passionate learner dedicated to expanding my knowledge in various fields.
            I am a dedicated <strong>student</strong> with a passion for learning and a drive to explore new ideas.
            As I navigate my academic journey, I am always eager to expand my knowledge and skills, 
            both inside and outside the classroom. I am committed to pushing myself to achieve academic
            excellence while balancing my personal growth and development. Every challenge I face is an 
            opportunity to learn, and I approach each one with an open mind and determination.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            In my studies, I focus on <strong>computer science</strong>. My passion lies in <strong>cybersecurity</strong>, especially in developing strategies
            <strong>to protect data and systems from cyber threats and ensuring privacy in the digital world</strong>,
            and I strive to deepen my understanding through research, projects, and collaboration with my peers. 
            I enjoy engaging in discussions and working on projects that challenge my perspectives and allow me to think critically.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Beyond academics, I’ve participated in a <strong>internship</strong> where I gained hands-on experience and applied 
            my classroom knowledge to real-world challenges. These activities help me develop leadership,
            teamwork, and time management skills. I believe in the importance of balancing work and life,
            and I am always seeking new ways to grow both personally and professionally. 
            My ultimate goal is to make a positive impact in my community and contribute meaningfully to the field I’m passionate about.
